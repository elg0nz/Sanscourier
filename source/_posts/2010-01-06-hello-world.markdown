Courier is the most common <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts" target="_blank">Programmers Font</a>, but who likes Common?

Courier is also the English word for Messenger, Do we really need them?

Hence, Sans Courier 100% Sans* Messengers, Serifs or Courier

*Sans: Without.
