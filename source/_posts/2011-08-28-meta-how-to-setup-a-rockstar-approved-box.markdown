How to Setup a Rockstar Approved Box
==========================================

Are you till using a php blog under apache as if it were still in 1998?
Or do you want to build an awesome C10k Approved host that
can also host Python / Rails and whatever else you might need?

Or you are just curious about how I setup this site?

You have come to the right place.

Grow up and breakup with your hosting
-------------------------------
Your Cheap PHP hosting company is actually not so cheap, you can get
a full linux box for the same amount of money, plus you can 
configure it to be a lean, mean, bit serving machine, that
can withstand any Slashdot effect (Reddit effect for you youngsters?)

Some awesome providers:
*Slicehost
*Amazon EC2
*Linode
*Heroku
*Joyent
*Google App Encine
