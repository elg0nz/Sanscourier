Meta: How to Setup a Rockstar Approved Box
==========================================

Are you till using a php blog under apache as if it were 1998?

can also host Python / Rails and whatever else you might need?

Or you are just curious about how I setup this site?

You have come to the right place.

Get a hosting for grownups
--------------------------
Your Cheap PHP hosting is actually not so cheap, you can get
a full linux box for the same amount of money, plus you can 
configure it to be a lean, mean, bit serving machine.

Some suggestions:
-Slicehost
-Amazon Web Services
-Linode
-Heroku
