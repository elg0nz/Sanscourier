This [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA) is probably one
of the most important reasons why I am, an Engineer, a creator, a dreamer.

Every year on the first day of the semester, one of my college teachers
used to put this video for all the EE freshmen, I think he still does it,
and though back then I thought it was a little bit cheesy;
many years later, after working in so many diverse environment I look back
and know he's right.

We must Think Different.

Here's to you Steve. ï£¿
