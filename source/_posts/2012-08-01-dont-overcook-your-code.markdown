“I had hoisted myself up on the shoulders of giants.”  
- Linus Torvalds (Paraphrasing Isaac Newton)

On Rework (One of the most interesting tech business books I've ever 
read), Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson include in its
acknowledgements some figures that I deeply admire:
Steve Jobs, Mies Van der Rohe, and Julia Child. I'll be focusing on her
and her cooking on this post.

Cooking and engineering (to use a more encompassing word than
programming), have many parallels, that span way beyond the simple metaphor that an
algorithm is like a cooking recipe; which it is, but that will be
another blog post.
Cooking is one of the things I love the most, possibly because when I'm
cooking something for dinner it's one of those few moments when I can
step away from the computer and just savor the moment. But as with coding,
it requires discipline and respect, which I'll be talking about here.

For the same reason you should be trying to attend conferences, 
if you want to become better at it you have to talk
about your craft, discuss, debate and chat with other cooks, and even possibly attend a
couple of classes and such (just like with coding, newbies make the
mistake of thinking that 'one day they will just learn everything there
is to learn about it'; 'it's only baking stuff' they say).

In one of the cooking classes I attended, the chef said this: 

“You should never overcook
pasta, because this is an offence; why? 

Because there is a whole culture behind this ingredient, from the person who
harvested and cut the wheat, to the mechanics who built the machine to
shape the pasta, to the packagers and distributors; there is a whole
industry around getting you that pasta, therefore overcooking your
spaghetti is disrespecting all their work, it's making all their
efforts pointless.”  

Programming is exactly the same. Whenever I design an API, I resonate
with Kenneth Reitz's remarks, code should be made to be beautiful and
useful. Doing otherwise, you are disrespecting all the work other people
did.

So whenever I get into any coding, I try to go back and look down into the shoulder
of our giants, and I see Denis Ritchie Unix Operating system (that it's still alive everywhere, from 
my cellphone, to the Mac computer I'm using to write this), Bob Joy's TCP/IP that drives all the Internet packages, 
I see WSGI and the middleware classes that make writing 
web code simpler, and I see Guido's Python that 
I use everyday and that serves as my trusty chef knife. 

And from the top of those shoulders, I can see miles ahead, and I
can no longer look down. 

I can't Overcook my code any longer, I can't design something that it's
not beautiful nor functional. I cannot disrespect all of their work.  

Julia Child became a chef, author and TV celebrity by deeply admiring 
French Cooking. She became great by
perfecting her craft and sharing it with the world, and she always
did this with the uttermost respect and sensibility, always
acknowledging where she got the secrets from.

Just like cooking, coding is a craft; and as such you too must respect all
the work your peers have done before, because we wouldn't be able to
look so far if weren't standing on the shoulder of giants.
