# The Koi Pond.

If you have ever been to San Francisco and are curious enough, you must have seen these small orange fishes everywhere.

The Koi fish.

According to Japanese legend, once there was a Koi who in spite of what all the other fish said, he wanted to swim to the
top of a waterfall.

So the fish went upstream on its own and after a long and arduous journey, he reached the top of that river.
The gods, being impressed with it's perseverance, turned him, as a reward, into a splendid and powerful dragon.

San Francisco, is our pond, full of Artists, Entrepreneurs, Code Artists, Pixel Dreamers.
Koi in San Francisco, let's become dragons.
