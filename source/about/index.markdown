A blog by Gonzalo Maldonado (@elg0nz).

"Creativity can solve almost any problem. The creative act, the defeat of habit by
orginality, overcomes everything."

I'm Gonzalo, a Bay Area based engineer hailing originally from Mexico City.

While I spend a lot of my time working on lines of code, I spend an equal amount of time thinking about
creativity. 

It's my opinion that the responsibilities of an engineer goes way beyond just
thinking about how to get something to work, we should also ask things like: How can this
work better and be beautiful? What can we do to go just beyond utility? It's questions like
these—and, honestly, probably many other totally random thoughts—that I'll be tackling in
this blog.
